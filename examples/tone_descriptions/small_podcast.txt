Keep my natural voice identity (timbre, accent, pitch range, age and gender) unchanged; only adjust pacing, emphasis and expressiveness. A calm, steady, and conversational podcast tone. Balanced pacing with clear articulation. Engaging and warm delivery that feels natural and inviting, suitable for long-form spoken content.
